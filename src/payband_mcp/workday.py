"""Workday, which hosts the enterprises that are on none of the startup boards.

Greenhouse, Ashby and Lever cover startups and scale-ups well and large
incumbents hardly at all. NVIDIA, Salesforce, Adobe, Cisco, HPE and eBay are
all on Workday, and every one of them was previously unreachable.

Two things make Workday different from the other boards:

* **The search response carries no pay.** A range only appears in the job
  description, which is a second request per posting. So postings are listed
  first, filtered by title, and only the survivors are fetched in full --
  otherwise answering one question about NVIDIA would mean 1,693 requests.
* **There is no slug to guess.** A tenant lives on one of several numbered
  hosts and exposes a site whose id is arbitrary ("NVIDIAExternalCareerSite",
  "External_Career_Site", "Jobsathpe"). Rather than brute-force that space,
  we read robots.txt, which names the public site in its Sitemap line. That
  is the file the site publishes to tell automated clients what to read, so
  discovery costs one cheap request per host and respects the site's own
  statement of what is public.
